# Vector Graphics with Processing

Join Code Liberation at NYC Resistor for a vector game design class in Processing where we will run through object classes, how to create sprites from vector graphics and produce a working game. We will have multiple monitors in the space so you can have your games shown on a real vector display! We are also be organizing a demo event at Babycastles shortly after so we'd love for you to keep producing games or vector art to be shown there.
